/**
 * PATCH_110: Wallet Withdrawal Request Model
 *
 * Tracks withdrawal requests from wallet balance.
 * All operations are atomic and reference WalletTransaction for audit trail.
 *
 * Flow:
 *   1. User requests → status=pending, withdrawable decremented, pendingWithdrawals incremented
 *   2. Admin approves → status=approved (no balance change yet)
 *   3. Admin marks paid → status=paid, balance decremented, pendingWithdrawals decremented
 *   4. Admin rejects  → status=rejected, withdrawable restored, pendingWithdrawals decremented
